# Description of the Data Collection Machine
This was created to run a big machine that can move a camera around, and record a certain "cell".
Each cell is essentially a 2 dimensional section, and the machine is built around a BUNCH of these cells. The cells are rectangular and laid out in a grid pattern.
Essentially the machine has a rasberry pi or other UNIX computer hooked up to it, which acts as the controller. The actual software of this controller is this project.
